# MAX3009-bluetooth
Design and Implementation of a Bioimpedance Measurement System Based on the MAX30009 System-on-Chip is a bachelor thesis conducted in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in 2025. Its purpose is to create a system able to obtain bio impedance using the MAX3009 SOC and custom firmware / software. 

The system created uses an Arduino Nano to communicate with the PC and the MAX3009 chip. The Arduino is connected to two main components: the MAX3009 chip and the EEPROM memory through the SPI communication protocol.

The way the Bluetooth transmission works is simple. In general, the PC requests a command, and the Arduino responds to it. For example, the following transmission is used when initializing the device and requesting the calibrated values to the EEPROM:
